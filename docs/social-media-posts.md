### Post 1 — Film Industry Groups (Filming in Florida, Indie Filmmakers, etc.)

Hey everyone — I built something I think a lot of us need.

**FilmContract** is a free app that lets actors and producers create, sign, and manage film contracts right from your phone. No more emailing PDFs back and forth or chasing down signatures.

Here's what it does:
- SAG-AFTRA and non-union contract templates ready to go
- Digital signatures that are legally binding
- Payment processing built in
- Professional profiles for actors and producers

I built this because I saw how messy the contract process is for independent productions. Figured there had to be a better way.

It's free to get started. Would love your feedback!

### Post 2 — Actors Groups (Actors Access, Acting Community, etc.)

Actors — tired of getting contracts as email attachments you can't even read on your phone?

I built **FilmContract**, a free app where you can:
- Review contracts with clear terms and compensation details
- Sign digitally from your phone (legally binding)
- Track all your contracts and payment history
- Build a verified professional profile

It's the first app built specifically for managing film contracts between actors and producers. No more printing, scanning, or chasing down paperwork.

Free to use. Check it out and let me know what you think!

**Title:** I built a free app for managing film contracts between actors and producers — would love feedback

I've been working on **FilmContract**, a mobile app that handles the entire contract lifecycle for film productions. It has SAG-AFTRA templates, digital signatures, payment processing, and professional profiles for actors and producers.

The problem I kept seeing: indie producers emailing Word docs, actors printing and scanning contracts, nobody tracking what was signed or paid. It's 2026 and we're still doing contracts like it's 1995.

So I built an app that handles it all from your phone — create a contract from a template, send it to the actor, they review and sign digitally, payment gets processed, everyone has a record.

It's free to get started (3 contracts/month on the free tier). Would genuinely love feedback from other filmmakers on what features matter most.

**Title:** Free app for actors to manage film contracts, sign digitally, and track payments

Hey r/acting — I built **FilmContract** because I was frustrated with how contracts work in the indie film world. Actors deserve better tools.

With FilmContract you can:
- Get a verified professional profile with your portfolio
- Review contract terms clearly on your phone
- Sign contracts digitally (legally binding e-signatures)
- Track your contract history and earnings
- Get notified when new opportunities come up

It's free to create your profile and manage up to 3 contracts per month. No catch.

I'm actively developing it and would love input from actors on what features would be most useful. What's your biggest pain point with contracts right now?

### r/Filmmaking

**Title:** After months of development, I'm launching FilmContract — the first all-in-one mobile contract platform for film

Built this for indie filmmakers who are tired of the contract chaos. **FilmContract** puts SAG-AFTRA templates, digital signatures, payment processing, and actor/producer profiles all in one app.

The idea is simple: you shouldn't need a lawyer and a printer to get a contract signed in 2026.

Free tier available. Would appreciate any feedback from the community.

### Professional Launch Announcement

I'm excited to announce the launch of **FilmContract** — the first all-in-one mobile platform for managing film industry contracts between actors and producers.

After seeing firsthand how fragmented and outdated the contract process is in independent film production, I set out to build a solution that brings the entire workflow into one place.

**The problem:** Film contracts still rely on email attachments, physical signatures, and manual payment tracking. For independent productions without legal departments, this creates delays, confusion, and risk.

**The solution:** FilmContract provides industry-standard contract templates (including SAG-AFTRA agreements), legally binding digital signatures through HelloSign, integrated payment processing via Stripe, and professional profiles for both actors and producers — all accessible from a mobile device.

**What makes it unique:** While enterprise contract management software exists for major studios, there has been no mobile-first solution designed specifically for independent actors and producers. FilmContract fills that gap.

The platform is free to get started, with professional tiers for users who need unlimited contracts and advanced features.

I would welcome feedback from entertainment industry professionals, fellow entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in the intersection of technology and creative industries.

## Email Template — Film Schools & Film Commissions

**Subject:** Free Contract Management Tool for Film Students/Productions

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out to introduce **FilmContract**, a free mobile platform I've developed for managing film contracts between actors and producers.

FilmContract provides SAG-AFTRA and non-union contract templates, digital signatures, payment processing, and professional profiles — all from a mobile device. It's designed to help independent productions handle contracts professionally without the overhead of traditional legal processes.

I believe this could be a valuable resource for [your students / productions in your state]. The platform is free to get started, and I'd be happy to provide a walkthrough or demo for your [department / organization].

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how FilmContract might benefit your community?
