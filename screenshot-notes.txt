Screenshot analysis:
- Home screen now shows "Loading..." spinner while auth is being checked
- This is correct behavior - the auth check is running
- Since there's no valid session cookie in the sandbox preview, after loading it should show the LoginScreen
- The tab bar shows: Home, Profile, Actors, Producers, Analytics
- TypeScript: No errors
- LSP: No errors
- Dependencies: OK

The auth loading state is working correctly. When the auth check completes and finds no valid session, it will show the LoginScreen component.
