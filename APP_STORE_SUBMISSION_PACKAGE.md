**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Prepared:** February 2026  
**Bundle ID:** space.manus.filmcontract

## 1. Store Listing — Apple App Store

### App Name (30 characters max)

> **FilmContract: Cast & Pay**

This title front-loads the brand name while incorporating two high-value search terms — "Cast" and "Pay" — that capture both sides of the marketplace. The colon format follows Apple's recommended pattern for subtitle-style titles.

### Subtitle (30 characters max)

> **Casting, Contracts & Escrow**

The subtitle targets three distinct keyword clusters that the title cannot cover. "Casting" captures actors searching for auditions, "Contracts" targets producers seeking deal management, and "Escrow" differentiates from competitors who lack payment protection.

### Keywords (100 characters max, comma-separated)

> `casting call,audition,self tape,actor,film contract,escrow payment,talent,production,hire talent,SAG`

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| casting call | High | Medium | Primary use case for actors |
| audition | High | High | Core industry term, broad reach |
| self tape | Medium | Low | Growing trend, low competition |
| actor | High | High | Broad audience capture |
| film contract | Medium | Low | Exact product match, low competition |
| escrow payment | Low | Very Low | Unique differentiator, no competitors |
| talent | Medium | Medium | Industry standard term |
| production | Medium | Medium | Captures producer searches |
| hire talent | Low | Low | Intent-rich, producer-focused |
| SAG | Medium | Low | Union actors actively searching |

**Note:** Words already in the title and subtitle are automatically indexed by Apple's algorithm and should not be repeated in the keyword field. "FilmContract," "Cast," "Pay," "Casting," "Contracts," and "Escrow" are excluded from the keyword list for this reason.

### Primary Category

> **Entertainment**

Entertainment is the natural home for casting and production apps. Casting Networks chose Productivity, but Entertainment aligns better with how actors search — they browse the Entertainment category when looking for industry tools. This also positions FilmContract alongside Backstage and Spotlight rather than competing with Google Docs and Slack.

### Secondary Category

> **Business**

Business captures the producer and production company audience who search for contract management and payment tools in a professional context.

### Full Description (4,000 characters max)

> FilmContract is the all-in-one platform where actors find roles and producers find talent — with built-in contracts and escrow payments that protect everyone.
>
> **FOR ACTORS**
>
> Browse open casting calls with smart filters for role type, union status, location, and pay range. Record broadcast-quality self-tapes with the built-in Pro Recorder featuring a scrolling teleprompter, multiple takes, quality presets (720p to 4K), and real-time filters. Edit your tapes with frame-accurate trimming, auto-generated slates, and compression before uploading. Track every submission from applied to hired with real-time status updates and push notifications.
>
> Set up Stripe Connect to receive payments directly. When a producer hires you, funds are held in escrow until the work is complete — then released to your account minus a small platform fee. No more chasing checks or wondering when you will get paid.
>
> **FOR PRODUCERS & CASTING DIRECTORS**
>
> Post casting calls in minutes with the 4-step wizard: set up your project, define roles with detailed breakdowns, add requirements and custom questions, then publish to the entire talent pool or invite-only. Boost your listing to the top of the feed with Featured placement.
>
> Review submissions in a Kanban pipeline — drag actors through Submitted, Reviewed, Shortlisted, Callback, Hired, and Passed stages. Watch self-tapes with adjustable playback speed, rate actors on a 4-category rubric (Acting, Look, Voice, Chemistry), compare tapes side-by-side, and export your notes as CSV. When you find the right talent, tap Hire and the contract wizard auto-fills with their details.
>
> **CONTRACTS & PAYMENTS**
>
> Generate industry-standard contracts with customizable templates for film, TV, commercial, and theater. Both parties e-sign in-app. Escrow payments protect actors and producers — funds are secured before work begins and released upon completion. Dispute resolution is built in.
>
> **KEY FEATURES**
> • Smart casting feed with filters and sorting
> • Pro self-tape recorder with teleprompter
> • Video editor with trim, slate, and compression
> • Resumable uploads with progress tracking

Add captions as text overlays — white SF Pro Display Bold at 48pt with a subtle drop shadow for readability.

## 5. App Review Guidelines

### Test Account Credentials

Provide two test accounts in the "Notes for Reviewer" field in App Store Connect.

| Role | Email | Password | What to Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Actor | `reviewer-actor@filmcontract.app` | `ReviewTest2026!` | Browse castings, record self-tape, submit application, view submissions, check earnings |
| Producer | `reviewer-producer@filmcontract.app` | `ReviewTest2026!` | Post casting call, review submissions, manage pipeline, create contract, fund escrow |

**Important:** These accounts must be pre-created in the production database before submission. The actor account should have a complete profile with headshot, and the producer account should have at least one active casting call with submissions to review.

### Feature Walkthrough for Reviewer

**Actor Flow (5 minutes):**

1. Log in with the actor test account. The Home screen displays open casting calls with filter options and a search bar.
2. Tap any casting call to view the detail screen with four tabs: Role Details, Production Info, Requirements, and Compensation.
3. Tap "Submit Self-Tape" to enter the self-tape flow. Choose "Record with Pro Recorder" to see the custom camera with teleprompter, quality presets, and takes management. Alternatively, choose "Pick from Library" to select an existing video.
4. After recording or selecting a video, the Editor screen allows trimming, adding a slate, and adjusting compression settings before export.
5. The Upload screen shows progress with pause/resume controls. After upload, the submission appears in "My Submissions" with real-time status tracking.
6. Navigate to Earnings to see the Stripe Connect onboarding flow (will show setup screen since test account is not connected to Stripe).
7. Tap the notification bell to view the Notification Center with grouped notifications and deep linking.

**Producer Flow (5 minutes):**

1. Log in with the producer test account. The Home screen shows casting analytics (total castings, open, applicants, hired) and active casting calls with applicant counts.
2. Tap "Post New Casting" to walk through the 4-step wizard: Project Setup, Role Creation, Requirements Builder, and Publish (with optional Featured boost).
3. Tap an existing casting call, then tap "View Submissions Pipeline" to see the Kanban board with submissions in different stages.
4. Tap any submission to open the Review screen with video playback (adjustable speed), star ratings, quick tags, timestamped notes, and action buttons (Shortlist, Callback, Hire, Pass).
5. Use the Compare tab to view two self-tapes side-by-side with synced playback.
6. Tap "Hire + Contract" on a shortlisted actor — this navigates to the Contract Wizard with the actor's details pre-filled, skipping directly to the Terms step.
7. Navigate to Payments to see the escrow dashboard with payment history and fund/release/dispute actions.

### Notes for Apple Reviewer

> This app requires an internet connection to function. All casting calls, contracts, and payments are managed through our backend server.
>
> **In-App Purchases:** The app offers three subscription tiers — Free (limited features), Pro ($49.99/month), and Studio ($199.99/month). Subscriptions are managed through Stripe, not Apple's In-App Purchase system. We are evaluating migration to StoreKit for compliance with App Store guidelines.
>
> **Payment Processing:** The app uses Stripe Connect for escrow payments between producers and actors. No payments are processed through Apple's payment system. This is a marketplace transaction between two parties, similar to Uber or Airbnb, which qualifies for the reader app / marketplace exemption.
>
> **Camera & Microphone:** The app requests camera and microphone access for self-tape recording. These permissions are only requested when the user initiates a recording session.
>
> **Push Notifications:** The app uses Expo Push Notifications to alert users about submission status changes, contract updates, and payment events.
>
> **Content:** All casting calls and user-generated content are moderated. The app does not contain user-generated content that could be considered objectionable.

## 9. Post-Launch ASO Optimization

### Week 1-2: Monitor and Adjust

Track keyword rankings for the top 10 keywords listed above. If any keyword ranks below position 50, consider swapping it for a more specific long-tail variant. Monitor conversion rate (impressions to installs) — if below 25%, the screenshots or description may need revision.

### Month 1: A/B Testing

Google Play supports store listing experiments natively. Test two variants: (A) current screenshots with gradient backgrounds, (B) screenshots with white backgrounds and bolder text. Run for 7 days with 50/50 traffic split.

### Month 2-3: Keyword Expansion

Add localized listings for Spanish (large SAG-AFTRA market in Los Angeles) and French (Canadian film industry). Update keywords based on search term performance data from App Store Connect analytics.

### Ongoing: Review Management

Respond to every 1-3 star review within 24 hours. Prompt satisfied users to leave reviews after successful contract completion or first payment received (use the `SKStoreReviewController` API, limited to 3 prompts per year per Apple guidelines).
