Bug Analysis: Producer Login Shows Success But App Is Stuck

CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSES:

1. Home screen (app/(tabs)/index.tsx) is COMPLETELY STATIC
   - Shows "Welcome" + "Sign in with your account" text
   - Does NOT import useAuth, LoginScreen, or RoleSelectionScreen
   - Does NOT check authentication state
   - Does NOT show contracts, quick actions, or any interactive content
   - After login, user sees the exact same static page - looks "stuck"

2. LoginScreen component EXISTS but is NEVER USED
   - Located at components/auth/login-screen.tsx
   - Has proper getLoginUrl() and OAuth flow
   - But no screen imports or renders it

3. RoleSelectionScreen component EXISTS but is NEVER USED
   - Located at components/auth/role-selection-screen.tsx
   - Has proper role selection (Producer/Actor) with updateRole mutation
   - But no screen imports or renders it

4. After OAuth login, user is redirected to /(tabs) which shows the static home screen
   - The OAuth callback (app/oauth/callback.tsx) redirects to /(tabs) after success
   - But /(tabs)/index.tsx doesn't check auth or show anything useful

5. The web preview uses cookie-based auth (Manus platform handles login)
   - User logs in via the Manus platform's OAuth
   - Cookie is set on the 3000-xxx domain
   - useAuth() fetches user from /api/auth/me
   - But the home screen never calls useAuth()!

FIX:
Rebuild the Home screen to:
1. Check auth state with useAuth()
2. If not authenticated: show LoginScreen (sign in button)
3. If authenticated but no role: show RoleSelectionScreen
4. If authenticated with role: show full dashboard
   - Contracts list
   - Quick action buttons (Create Contract, Browse Actors, Messages, etc.)
   - Recent activity
