FilmContract connects independent film producers and actors on a single platform — from casting to contracts to payment.

Whether you're a producer searching for the right talent or an actor looking for your next role, FilmContract streamlines the entire process with professional tools built specifically for the film industry.

▸ CASTING CALLS
Producers post detailed casting calls with role descriptions, budgets, and deadlines. Actors browse, filter, and apply directly from their phone. No more scattered emails or missed opportunities.

▸ AUDITION SUBMISSIONS
Actors submit audition tapes directly through the app. Producers review submissions in a clean pipeline view, shortlist favorites, and hire with one tap.

▸ DIGITAL CONTRACTS
Create legally-structured contracts from industry templates or build custom agreements. Both parties sign digitally with timestamps and full audit trails. Every contract is stored securely and accessible anytime.

▸ ESCROW PAYMENTS
All payments flow through Stripe-powered escrow. Funds are held safely until both parties confirm delivery. No more chasing payments or worrying about disputes. FilmContract charges a transparent 7.5% platform fee — no subscriptions, no hidden costs.

▸ MESSAGING
Communicate directly with producers or talent. Discuss project details, negotiate terms, and coordinate schedules without leaving the app.

▸ PROFESSIONAL PROFILES
Actors build profiles with headshots, bios, demo reels, and portfolio photos. Producers showcase their company and project history. Both sides can discover and evaluate each other before committing.

▸ REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS
Get notified instantly when someone submits to your casting call, when you're shortlisted, when a contract is ready to sign, or when a payment is released.

## Google Play Keyword Strategy

Google Play uses the full description for keyword indexing (unlike Apple, which uses a separate keyword field). The description above naturally incorporates these target keywords:

| Primary Keywords | Secondary Keywords |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| film contracts | indie film |
| casting calls | talent management |
| actor | freelance entertainment |
| producer | digital contracts |
| audition | escrow payments |
| entertainment | film industry |
| casting | audition tapes |

The key difference from the iOS listing: Google Play weighs the **first 1-2 sentences** heavily for search ranking, which is why the opening line includes "producers," "actors," "casting," "contracts," and "payment" — the five highest-value keywords.
