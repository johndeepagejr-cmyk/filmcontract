Hi [First Name],

You signed up because you were tired of the same problems every indie filmmaker faces: scattered casting calls, contracts drafted in Google Docs, and payments that arrive late — or never.

**FilmContract is now live on the App Store and Google Play.**

Here's what you can do starting today:

**If you're a producer:**
Post casting calls, review audition tapes in a clean pipeline, create contracts from industry templates, and pay your talent through secure escrow. The money is locked before work begins and released when both sides agree.

**If you're an actor:**
Browse casting calls, submit auditions directly, track your applications in real time, and get paid through escrow — no more chasing payments.

**What it costs:** Nothing to download. A 7.5% fee applies only when money moves through escrow. No subscriptions. No listing fees.
