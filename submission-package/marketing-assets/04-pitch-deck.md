*For investor conversations, partnership discussions, and accelerator applications.*

## The Problem

Independent film is a **$5B+ industry** built on handshake deals. Producers manage casting across 4-5 platforms, draft contracts in Word documents, and process payments through personal Venmo or wire transfers. Actors have no guarantee they will be paid. The result: disputes, delays, and talented people leaving the industry.

## The Solution

**FilmContract** is a mobile platform that consolidates casting, contracts, and payments into one secure workflow. Producers post casting calls, review auditions, create digital contracts, and pay through escrow. Actors browse roles, submit tapes, sign contracts, and receive guaranteed payments.

## How It Works

| Step | Producer | Actor |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1. Discover | Posts casting call | Browses open roles |
| 2. Connect | Reviews audition tapes | Submits audition |
| 3. Contract | Creates and sends contract | Reviews and signs digitally |
| 4. Pay | Funds escrow | Receives payment on delivery |

## Business Model

FilmContract is **free to download** with a **7.5% platform fee** on completed escrow transactions. No subscriptions, no listing fees. Revenue scales directly with transaction volume.

| Metric | Projection |
|--------|-----------|
| Average transaction size | $2,500 |
| Platform fee per transaction | $187.50 |
| Year 1 target transactions | 2,000 |
| Year 1 projected revenue | $375,000 |
| Year 2 target (3x growth) | $1,125,000 |

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| U.S. independent film production | $5B+ annually |
| Global film & TV production | $177B (2025) |
| Freelance entertainment workers (U.S.) | 600,000+ |
| SAG-AFTRA members | 160,000+ |

The initial target market is U.S.-based independent film productions with budgets under $1M — a segment underserved by enterprise tools like Movie Magic and too professional for Craigslist or Facebook Groups.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | What They Do | What They Miss |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Backstage | Casting listings ($20/mo) | No contracts, no payments |
| Casting Networks | Casting + profiles ($40/mo) | No contracts, no payments |
| Fiverr/Upwork | Freelance marketplace | Not film-specific, 20%+ fees |
| DocuSign | Digital signatures | No casting, no payments |
| **FilmContract** | **All-in-one: casting + contracts + escrow** | **—** |

## Traction

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| App status | Live on iOS and Android |
| Tech stack | React Native (Expo), Stripe Connect, PostgreSQL |
| Payment infrastructure | Stripe Connect with escrow (live mode) |
| Test accounts with seed data | Ready for demo |
