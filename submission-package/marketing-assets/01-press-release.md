## FilmContract Launches to Bring Secure Contracts, Casting, and Payments to Independent Film

*New mobile app eliminates paperwork and payment uncertainty for producers and actors*

**[City, State] — [Launch Date], 2026** — FilmContract, a new mobile platform built specifically for independent film professionals, is now available on the App Store and Google Play. The app combines casting calls, digital contracts, and Stripe-powered escrow payments into a single workflow, replacing the fragmented tools that producers and actors have relied on for decades.

Independent film production has long suffered from a trust gap. Producers post casting calls across scattered platforms, negotiate terms over email, draft contracts in Word documents, and process payments through personal Venmo or wire transfers. Actors, meanwhile, have no reliable way to verify that they will be paid for their work. FilmContract closes that gap.

"We built FilmContract because we saw talented people walking away from projects — not because of creative differences, but because of payment disputes and contract confusion," said [Founder Name], founder of FilmContract. "Every transaction on our platform goes through escrow. The money is there before work begins, and it's released when both sides agree the job is done."

### How It Works

**For Producers:** Post a casting call with role details, budget, and deadline. Review audition submissions in a pipeline view. Hire talent with one tap, generate a contract from industry templates, and fund the escrow. When the work is delivered, release the payment.

**For Actors:** Browse open casting calls, submit audition tapes directly through the app, and track application status in real time. When hired, sign the contract digitally and receive payment through secure escrow — no more chasing checks.

### Key Features

FilmContract offers professional-grade tools that were previously available only through expensive enterprise software or fragmented free tools:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Casting Calls | Post and browse with role details, budgets, and deadlines |

| Digital Contracts | Industry templates with digital signatures and audit trails |
| Escrow Payments | Stripe Connect-powered with 7.5% platform fee |
| Messaging | Direct communication between producers and actors |
