Producers: stop managing casting calls in spreadsheets.

FilmContract lets you:
• Post casting calls

### Tweet 3 — Actor Angle

```
Actors: tired of not getting paid?

FilmContract puts every payment in escrow before work begins. When both sides agree the job is done, the money moves.

No more chasing checks. No more "the check is in the mail."

```

### Tweet 4 — Problem/Solution Thread

```
🧵 Why we built FilmContract:

1/ Indie film has a trust problem. Producers can't find reliable talent. Actors can't trust they'll get paid. Contracts are afterthoughts.

2/ We talked to 50+ filmmakers. The same problems came up every time: scattered casting, handshake deals, late payments.

3/ So we built one app that handles the entire workflow: casting → audition → contract → escrow payment.

4/ Every dollar goes through Stripe escrow. The money is locked before work starts. Released when both sides agree.

5/ It's free to download. 7.5% fee only on completed transactions. No subscriptions.

6/ Available now on iOS and Android: filmcontract.app

### Post 1 — Professional Launch Announcement

```
Today we're launching FilmContract — a mobile platform that brings secure contracts, casting, and escrow payments to independent film production.

The problem we're solving:

Independent film is a $5B+ industry built on handshake deals. Producers post casting calls across 4-5 different platforms. Contracts are drafted in Word documents and signed via email. Payments happen through personal Venmo or wire transfers — if they happen at all.

FilmContract consolidates the entire workflow into one app:

• Producers post casting calls and review audition submissions
• Actors browse roles and submit tapes directly
• Both parties sign digital contracts with audit trails
• All payments flow through Stripe-powered escrow

The business model is simple: free to use, 7.5% platform fee on completed transactions. No subscriptions, no listing fees.

We're live on iOS and Android today: filmcontract.app

If you work in film, entertainment, or marketplace technology, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
